# INTRODUCTION
#--------------------
Machine learning tasks:
    - Classification; output is one of a number of classes ex. 'A'
    - Regression; output is a real value ex. $35/share

Machine learning types:
    - Supervised; Provide training with correct answers
    - Unsupervised; No feedback. Clustering based on similarity.
    - Semi-supervised; some feedback is provided, but not detailed.
    
Instance; Individual example of a particular class.
    - trainPokemon(perceptron,instance)
Feature; Collection of attributes of a single instance
Feature Vector; N-dimensional vector describing a single instance 
Data:
    - Training; Used to train the model
    - Validation; Used to select model complexity, to determine further training time, method
    - Test; Used to evaluate trained model

# PERCEPTRONS
#--------------------
Input is (x1, x2, ... xn)
Weights are (w1, w2, ... wn) 
Output = y(x) = sgn(w0 x0 +w1x1 +w2 x2 +...+wn xn )

Classifictaiton Methods:
    - One vs. All;
    - All-pairs
    
Stochastic gradient descent:
    ► Δwi = −η ( ∂J / ∂wi ) = η x[i]^k t^k
 -----
    ► wi ← wi + Δwi
    ► Δw[i] =η (x[i]^k) (t^k) || η (input)(target)
    
How to interpret / fill in a confusion matrix:
        - Identity are the accurate values
        - accuracy = (# of right / Total)
